A business process is a series of steps performed by a group of stakeholders to achieve a concrete goal. These steps are often repeated many times, sometimes by multiple users and ideally in a standardized and optimized way. A business process can be manual or automated. If manual, the process is achieved without the aid of an automation or assisting technology. If automated, a technology aid has been put into place which assists users in implementing the process in a more accurate, standardized or optimized manner.
