Easy win for the customer. My buddy Steve actually just went through this experience for the first time. He’s had a Macbook for three years but never had a problem until now. I told him about the Genius Bar, he looked suspicious (like it was too good to be true) but gave it a crack. I saw him the next day with his Macbook repaired – 24 hour turnaround on a broken hard drive – now that’s a good customer experience!
